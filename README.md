# final_life_restart.github.io
This project's structure is based on the open resource game Life Restart. 
But I didn't use any code from that open source project. 
Instead, I write them all one my own, and I can complete most of the functions.
The story I used in the code is half by myself and half by Chatgpt which I used to extend the story.
Since I don't have time to complete all the stories, I only create 13 branches of stories.
These stories are based on the choose of charactor and the select of attributes.
The design of choosing charactor page is from another designer which is also a open source design code.
The images I used in this website are all generate from the Chatgpt.
